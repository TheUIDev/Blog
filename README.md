# The UI Dev

## Description
This is my personal blog currently being migrated from Blogger to Github Pages.
You might know this blog as `Spatial Unlimited` from blogger or `The UI Dev` from my previous Jekyll based Github Pages blog.

It made a lot of sense to name my blog `Spatial Unlimited` when I started writing and then eventually migrating it to `The UI Dev` which aligns well with what I have been working on lately - Frontend.
